# Microsoft Power BI visuals plus custom visuals by MAQ Software

The Microsoft Power BI visuals project provides high quality data visualizations that you can use to extend [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/).  The project contains over 20 visualization types plus custom visuals by MAQ Software, the framework to run them, and the testing infrastructure that enables you to build high quality visualizations.  The framework provides all the interfaces you need to integrate fully with Power BI's selection, filtering, and other UI experiences.  The code is written in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) so it's easier to build and debug. Everything compiles down to JavaScript and runs in modern web browsers.  The visuals are built using [D3](http://d3js.org/) but you can use your favorite technology like [WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL), [Canvas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element), or [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics). This gives you everything you need to build custom visualizations for Power BI.

| Gantt Chart is used for <br />scheduling and management of <br />task. While an ordinary Gantt <br />Chart just displays the basic <br />details like task id or name <br />and their schedules, Gantt <br />Chart by MAQ Software <br />provides more details of the <br />task by providing a grid <br />where one can view more data <br />related to the task and can <br />display the hierarchy of data <br />category. Also, data can be <br />sorted based on any data point <br />of the task. <br />For example, take case of <br />project management, while <br />other visuals will just <br />provide project id/name, <br />start time, end time and <br />current status, this visual <br />can provide additional <br />details (data points) apart <br />from the mentioned such as <br />duration of project, owner of <br />the project along with KPIs <br />such as 'priority' etc. on a <br />grid as separate columns <br />inside the visual itself. <br />Apart from additional <br />information about the <br />project, this visual let the <br />user view project hierarchy <br />(i.e.) tasks under any <br />project and their progress. <br />User can sort the project/task <br />based on their data points as <br />present on the grid column. <br />The visual lets you configure <br />the detailing of information <br />as per requirement. Other <br />formatting features can <br />represent information in a <br />way that best tells the story <br />of your data. <br /><br /><img src="https://github.com/maqsoftware/PowerBI-visuals/blob/master/documents/Internal/GanttChart/Gantt300x300.png" alt="Gantt Chart" height="268" width="268"> | Slope Chart allows users to <br />analyze trends in data at a <br />glance.

# PowerBI Visual Tools (pbiviz) - Installation

Before you can get started you'll need to install the tools. This should only take a few seconds.

## Dependencies

Before you can run (or install) the command line tools you must install NodeJS.

* NodeJS 4.0+ Required (5.0 recommended) - [Download NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)


## Installation
[![Npm Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/powerbi-visuals-tools.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/powerbi-visuals-tools)
[![Npm Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/powerbi-visuals-tools.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/powerbi-visuals-tools)  
To install the command line tools simply run the following command

```bash
npm install -g powerbi-visuals-tools
```

To confirm it was installed correctly you can run the command without any paremeters which should display the help screen.

```bash
pbiviz
```

## Server certificate setup

To enable live preview visual assets need to be served on a trusted https server so before you can start you need to install an ssl certificate which will allow visual asssets to load in your web browser. This is a one time setup.

* [How to install the local SSL certificates](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals/blob/master/tools/CertificateSetup.md) 

## Enable developer visual

To view/test your visual in PowerBI you need to enable the development visual and then you can add it to any report.

* [How to enable the developer visual in PowerBI](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals/blob/master/tools/DebugVisualSetup.md)

# Running the visuals in this repository 
Select the visual you want to run. Navigate to the root of visual project (the directory containing `pbiviz.json`). Simply run the following commands

```bash
#This will install modules listed in package.json
npm install 

#This will install type definitions listed in typings.json
typings install 

#To run the visual
pbiviz start
```

That's it you are good to go. You can see that the visual is running.
